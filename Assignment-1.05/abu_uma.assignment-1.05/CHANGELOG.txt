Wednesday August 29th: 
    Started the project and figured out a way to use random numbers to pick a spot on the x and y axis for random room. I also figured out how to make the 
    borders.

Thursday August 30th: 
    Printed out the first room and from there I had problem with the random number genertor because it gave the same random number everytime. 
    I asked the professor in class and he fixed the problem for me. Later that day, I printed out random rooms. 

Friday August 31st: 
    I started having problems with the boarders and the rooms. When the borders are printed, they do not align with the room. The functions
    that prints the boarder started printing random numbers. 

Saturday September 1st: 
    I figured out how to fix the border issues by printing the boarder when all the rooms have finished generating 

Sunday September 2nd: 
    Figured out how to make the corridors for the rooms. Using the x and y coordinate for the rooms. 

Tuesday September 4th: 
    Cleaning out the code and commenting out print statements that may be used in the future. Also creating the read me file.

Friday September 7th: 
    Starting out assignment 2 I am using professors code from homework 1. 

Saturday September 8th: 
   After reading the professors code, it took me a while to understand what he did and I finally understand some parts. I started writing the save method. 

Monday September, 10th: 
     I finished writing the save method but it has not been tested yet and now I am writing the load method. The methods are pretty similar and so this did not take time to write.

Tuesday September, 11th: 
	I went to lecture today and learnt about endian conversions and so I am using endian conversions in my code to convert between the host and my machine as the professor said. I am having problems with the endian conversions. I switched machines to the linux computer and everthing worked out well.

Wednesday September, 12th: 
	Code works so I can now read and write rooms but I am having problems reading the professors files. Going to office hours. 

Saturday September, 15th;
	I studied the professors corridor making path because he had announced to use this for the next homework. I also had to go and refresh my knowledge on dikjstras algorithm

Sunday September, 13th: I started coding. I finished the two main methods that get the paths ie the tunneling path and the non tunneling path. I am yet to compile the code for errors or to create the methods that print the distances. 

Monday September, 14th: I finished the code for the methods that print the distances for the tunneling and non tunneling distance. I have not tested them tho but I finished them.

Tuesday September, 15th: I tested the code for the distances and I had a lot of bugs. I fixed the bugs and the code finally runs fine. I am figuring out how to test the code with professors dungeons. 

Wednesday, September, 16th: Test the code and it works fine. Ready to submit.

Wednesday, September, 26th: Starting the new project. Using the processors code. 

Thursday, September, 27th: I deceided to stucture my code in the way professor did making a monster.h file to hold methods and variable used by monsters that would be called by multiple classes and a monster.c file to hold the code for the monsters.

Friday, September, 28th: I started coding the methods for the homework. I had some questions about the homework and it took me a while to full understand what to do. 

Saturday, September, 29th: Still coding, added a few more methods for the project, hopefully they work: still coding

Sunday, October 30th: I finally coded a lot of the methods and I am still on visual studio code using my mac. This helps me work easier. I am about to zip the project and email it to my self to run and test it in Fedora virtual machine. 
I ran the code on the fedora and I have 64 errors. I am about to sort them one by one and figure them out.

Monday, October, 1st: I am still trying to fix the code and I am having alot of errors, managed to fix some

Tuesday, October 2nd: I think I fixed all the bugs and the code should be ready to be submitted. it works. Modified some methods after asking questions in class today


Saturday, October 6th: I started the homework from the profess code, Read a little more about Ncurses and I am trying to figure out what to do.

Monday, October 8th: Still trying to figure out how to get the getch method to work with the key press. So far i think it has to do with the keycode
but im still working on it. 

Tuesday, October 9th: Figure out how to use get and added that with movement. Had a bug were the players wouldnt get on stairs so i asked on 
piazza and i got help from Professor Jeremy. Added the stair features, working on the monster list in a new window.

Wednesday, October 10th: Figure out the homework is getting extended so .....

Friday, October 12th: Figured out how to add a window but im having issues getting it to stay on the screen. Started workning on getting the list of 
monsters

Sunday, October 14: Got the list and the window to work also worked on scrolling, time to submit.
