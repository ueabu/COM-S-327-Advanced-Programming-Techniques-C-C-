I copied the professors code from homework 2 to start the homework 3. I also copied and modified majority of his find corridor method from to make my methods for the tunneling and non tunneling distance. For both method, I used the advice he gave which was to use dikjstras algorithm to impement the solution. It was complicated at first but after figuring out how dijkstras algorithm worked, I finally made the functions. There are some methods that I made like the playerpcX and playercY that are supposed to return the player locations of the player character but I never used them because I was told we could just place the player character in the first spot of the first room. 
The notable functions made were dijkstrastunneling, dikstras_nontunneling, print_tunneling and print_nontunneling. The use the dijkstras algorithm to implement tunneling functions and the print_tunneling and the print_nontunneling are helper methods to print the distances by calling the dikjstras tunneling method. 

I also made edits to the main methods and commented out some seeds that were having issues that eventually fixed. The code works fine with everthing. To run it, run the command make then ./rgl327 or you can save files and load files too.
