Wednesday August 29th: 
    Started the project and figured out a way to use random numbers to pick a spot on the x and y axis for random room. I also figured out how to make the 
    borders.

Thursday August 30th: 
    Printed out the first room and from there I had problem with the random number genertor because it gave the same random number everytime. 
    I asked the professor in class and he fixed the problem for me. Later that day, I printed out random rooms. 

Friday August 31st: 
    I started having problems with the boarders and the rooms. When the borders are printed, they do not align with the room. The functions
    that prints the boarder started printing random numbers. 

Saturday September 1st: 
    I figured out how to fix the border issues by printing the boarder when all the rooms have finished generating 

Sunday September 2nd: 
    Figured out how to make the corridors for the rooms. Using the x and y coordinate for the rooms. 

Tuesday September 4th: 
    Cleaning out the code and commenting out print statements that may be used in the future. Also creating the read me file.
